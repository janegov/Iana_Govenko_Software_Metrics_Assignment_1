Report for the Python code:
------------------------
I used the code from the QA exam, which was named broken_img.py
For the test, first of all I used pylint, which showed me that I have
8.52/10 code and suggestet to improve following errors: missing class docstring,
missing function or method docstring, missing timeout argument,
unused import time.
After that I used flake8 test which showed me next errors: 'time' imported but not used,
expected 2 blank lines after class or funtion definition, found 1,
no new line at the end of the code.
Bandit test showed me that my code is not secure and I have the next issues in my code:
request_without_timeout, severity: Medium, Confidence: Low, CWE: CWE-400
Run metrics: medium: 1
  Total issues: low: 1
File skipped (0):
Pygount test showed that I have 28 source code lines

Before Improvement:
-----------------------
Total Lines of Code (LOC): 39
Physical Lines of Code(PLOC): 28
Number of Comment Lines: 1
Number of Blank Lines: 6

*On screenshots the name of the file is different because I changed
the name for better understanding where is the new/old code (before it was named main.py)

Pylint: 10/10
Bandit: secure code
