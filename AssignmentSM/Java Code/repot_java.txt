Total Lines of Code (LOC): 147 (my VSC adds automatically new line in the end of the code because I changed the settings for imroving my python code)
Physical Lines of Code(PLOC): 132
Number of Comment Lines: 0
Number of Blank Lines: 13

Suggestions for Improvement:
-----------------------
java.io.IOException and java.io.PrintStream are not used, so we can delete it from the code.
Addinig the comments would be better for providing the better understanding of the code.
